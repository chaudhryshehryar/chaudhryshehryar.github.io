            <h1>Hi, I am <br> <span>Muhammad Shehryar <br> Chaudhry</span></h1>
            <p>An electronics hobbyist, average programmer,
             and a computer science student at the<br> University of Technology Sydney. </p>
             <P><br> "Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes," Edsger Dijkstra. <br>
                  This theory has been revolving in my mind for a very long time. Something about that rectangular box of
                  information <br>has always intrigued me. While others were busy playing Need for Speed special editions 
                   and fighting whose turn it was <br>to take racing cars on tracks or completing missions in GTA, my mind
                   occupied by theories of how the computer might be <br>doing all this. Of how computers worked, why they
                    worked, and what else they could do? <br> Perhaps I was interested in the motion of the stars. 
                    Not with the telescope.</P>
